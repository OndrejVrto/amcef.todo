# Simple ToDo app

The application was created as a test project in one weekend. May contain errors. I will be glad if you draw my attention to it.

## Assignment

### Create a simple ToDo app in Laravel that should contain:
- [x] Registration and login (auth)
- [x] Creating ToDo items
- [x] Sharing ToDo items with other users (+ cancellation of sharing)
- [x] Classification of items into categories (can be static but stored in DB, at least 3)
- [x] Marking items as completed
- [x] Editing items (name, description...)
- [x] Deleting items + undo (in case of unwanted deletion)
- [x] Filtering by category, by whether they are completed, by whether they are mine or shared
- [x] Sending emails/notifications - when sharing items, marking done, etc.

### Static app (for fullstack developer):
- [x] Using HTML + Custom (SCSS/LESS/SASS - not pure CSS)/Bootstrap/Material/Tailwind
- [x] Logically structured views

### REST API (for backend developer):
- [ ] Auth must be stateless according to REST principles
- [ ] Comply with REST principles
- [ ] Add pagination to the list of ToDo items

### Other:
- [x] code purity
- [x] using the right patterns, styles, functions and principles of the language.

### In addition:
- [x] Policy implementation for individual actions
- [x] Notifications to the database and email
- [x] displaying notifications in the main application window and hiding them
- [x] work with the date in the form
- [x] record sorting
- [x] custom bootstrap css
- [x] nice status icons
- [x] minified html code using middlerware
- [x] created instruction manual with image for social media
- [x] use of the package to reduce the number of requests to google fonts
- [x] multilingual forms
